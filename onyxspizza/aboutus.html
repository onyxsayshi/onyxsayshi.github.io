<h2 class="h2">How We Came to Be</h2>
	<p id="p"> My husband was 29 when he passed, we had just bought our restaurant. It was while the big move a refrigerator fell on him and crushed him, killing him because of the internal bleeding it had caused . We had gotten married when we were in our early 20's and were getting ready to have our first child and run the business we'd always dreamed of but life had other plans. Two months after his passing I had thought about selling our restaurant because it was too much to bare running it without him but deep down I knew he would've wanted me to keep going and it brought me to what we are today, and he'd be so proud. So thank you for supporting our business. P.S. Make sure you say hi, his ashes are at the front entrance. </p>
<h2 class="h2">Where My Recipes Came From </h2>
	<p id="p">My recipes aren't like any other they come from a long family line of pizza makers, I learned to make the pizza from my mom who has since passed in a car accident. I remember the Sunday nights in the kitchen with mom, it always brought a smile to my face so I made it my career. I wanted to make pizza my entire life and that's exactly what I did and everyone enjoys my work. </p>
